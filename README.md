# Intrinsic Curiosity Module :
The Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM) is a fascinating concept in RL designed to help agents explore their environments effectively, especially when external rewards are rare or non-existent.
It solves the problem of sparse rewards i.e. when the rewards are very tough to find, the agents starts doing random things . ICM helps this by giving the agent an intrinsic reward (internal motivation) based on curiosity.

When the agent do some task , and if its prediction is wrong, it means it has encountered something new and it receives a high intrinsic reward.
